1/16/2018, Affordable Housing Agreement, "Initially established in 2014, the agreement outlines affordable housing commitments for a project located at 1-7 Dalton Street, Boston. It requires the creation of affordable housing units to comply with a city executive order. One Dalton is responsible for fulfilling these commitments, initially through off-site rental units and later through a combination of rental and for-sale units. The amendment extends the period of affordability for for-sale units and adjusts income eligibility criteria for certain units within the project.",  https://bpda.app.box.com/s/7aoyd4pd35v10zce9nulef6t31pudhu7
